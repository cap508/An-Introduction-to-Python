\section{A place for everything ...} \label{sec:Variables}

In this section we look at how we store information in programs and get the information back. We talk about variables and variable typing in Python. We then introduce the concept of lists and dictionaries. we introduce the print function and show how it can display variables with and without labels.


We also consider mathematical operators and concatenation etc. We introduce functions as something that can operate on variables.
